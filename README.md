# election-analysis
## Project Overview
- This project delivers on determining the election results for the Colorado Board of Elections. The code gives the winning candidate and also the breakdown of all of the candidates that ran for office. The code also determines which county brought in the most votes while also giving the breakdown of the votes by county.
## Resources
- election_results.csv
- Python 3.9 and VS Code 
## Summary/Analysis

- This code could be modified for future election analysis so that more elections can be analyzed quickly and fairly. A way the code could be changed for future elections is to print out the results so that it is immediately ready for a press release. Another way to modify the code is to include political party data so that further analysis can be made.
